<h1>Exception Handling in C++</h1>

<h2>Errors</h2>
It's very rare that a large program or software works correctly the first time. It might have errors.
The two most common types of errors are:
<ul><li>
Logical errors</li>
<li>Syntactic errors</li>
</ul>
Programmers can debug these errors by exhausting debugging and testing procedures. 
But programmers often come across some peculiar problems in addition logic or syntax errors. 
These types of errors are known as exceptions. 

<h2>Exceptions</h2>
Exceptions are run-time anomalies or unusual logical conditions that may come up while executing the C ++ program.
There are two types of exceptions:
<ul><li>Synchronous(Out of range index, overflow)</li>
<li>Asynchronous(Ex:which are beyond the programâ€™s control, Disc failure , Keyboard interrupts etc)</li></ul>

<h2>Exception Handling</h2>
Exceptions allow a method to react to exceptional circumstances and errors (like runtime errors) within programs 
by transferring control to special functions called handlers.
