<h1>Knapsack Problem </h1>

Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine a subset of items to include in a collection 
so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
The knapsack problem is in combinatorial optimization problem.

__In the 0-1 Knapsack problem, we are not allowed to break items. We either take the whole item or donâ€™t take it.__
