Ans:

2. Consider a three word machine instruction. ADD A[R0], @ B ,The first operand (destination) "A [R0]" uses indexed addressing mode with R0 as the index register. 
The second operand (source) "@ B" uses indirect addressing mode. A and B are memory addresses residing at the second and the third words, respectively. 
The first word of the instruction specifies the opcode, the index register designation and the source and destination addressing modes. During execution of ADD instruction, 
the two operands are added and stored in the destination (first operand). The number of memory cycles needed during the execution cycle of the instruction is

3. "Consider the following relational schema:
  employee(empId, empName, empDept)
  customer(custId, custName, salesRepId, rating) salesRepId is a foreign key referring to empId of the employee relation. Assume that each employee makes a sale to at least one customer. What does the following query return?
SELECT empName
       FROM employee E
       WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT custId
                          FROM customer C
                          WHERE C.salesRepId = E.empId
                            AND C.rating <> `GOOD`);"

5. A system uses FIFO policy for page replacement. It has 4 page frames with no pages loaded to begin with. 
The system first accesses 100 distinct pages in some order and then accesses the same 100 pages but now in the reverse order. How many page faults will occur?
