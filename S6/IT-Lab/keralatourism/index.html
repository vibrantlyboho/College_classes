              <p align="justify">Flanked by the Arabian Sea in the West, the towering Western Ghats in the East 
                  and networked by 44 interconnected rivers, Kerala is blessed with a unique set of 
                  geographical features that have made it one of the most sought after tourist 
                  destinations in Asia. A long shoreline with serene beaches, tranquil stretches 
                  of emerald backwaters, lush hill stations and exotic wildlife, are just a few of 
                  the wonders that await you once you crossover to the other side. And what's more, 
                  each of these charming destinations is only a two hour drive from the 
                  other - a singular advantage no other place on the planet can offer.</p>             
              <p align="justify">Kerala prides itself for being the flag bearer for not just how a culture can 
                  respect its past but also march forward with growth & progress as well. 
                  Hundred percent literacy, world-class health care systems, India's lowest 
                  infant mortality and highest life expectancy rates are among a few of the 
                  milestones that the people of the state are extremely proud of.</p>
