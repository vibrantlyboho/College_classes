                <p>The festival season, the pride and joy of Kerala, is epitomised by the ferocious beats of the chenda (drums) emanating across the landscape. Elephants march across towns and the rivers surge with massive 100 feet long snake boats in a display that can only be experienced in an area renowned as God's Own Country. The entire State celebrates together as the land is covered in a plethora of lights and merriment.  </p>
                <p>Our festivals celebrate the traditions passed down by our ancestors. Be it Onam, Eid or Christmas, all of Kerala rejoices with one spirit to bring the entire coastal State to life. From seeing mystical figures come to life during Theyyam performances to strolling across various churches and mosques where the lights and displays are at their best during perunnals and memorials, every nook and cranny of our State has something to offer to each traveller.</p>
                <p>From religious occasions to festivals for specific deities, Kerala is home to a great heritage of festivals. The festivals of Kerala personify the very spirit and essence of the land and these experiences will be forever etched in your heart.</p>
