"This is the Unix philosophy:

Write programs that do one thing and do it well.

Write programs to work together. 

Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface."

>some commands are composed of the first two consonants of the word (e.g. cp, ls, rm, mv)
>
>some commands are composed of the first letter(s) of more than one word (e.g. cd, pwd, grep, lpr, chmod, mkdir)
>
>some commands are entire words (or multiple words) (e.g. exit, who, finger, date, cut, whoami)
>
>some commands are composed of the initials of the folks who created them (e.g. awk)
>
>some options with the same letters typically do similar things for multiple commands (e.g. -l, -v, -a), for as much as this makes sense
